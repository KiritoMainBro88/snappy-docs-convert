# Snappy Docs Convert

Snappy Docs Convert is planned as a fast local document conversion app for Windows-first workflows.

Current phase: Phase 0/1 local Codex workspace setup. This branch only adds agent instructions, research notes, context-packing workflow, phase prompts, and lightweight local checks. It does not implement or expand converter behavior.

## Final Goal

- Convert DOCX, PPTX, PDF, pages, and slides locally.
- Use Microsoft Office COM on machines with Office installed for high-fidelity Office export.
- Use LibreOffice headless as the no-Office fallback.
- Export PDF pages and presentation slides as real images through renderer/export APIs, not screenshots.
- Support batch files and a polished Windows desktop UI in later phases.

## Privacy Promise

- Local-only processing by default.
- No cloud upload.
- No telemetry, analytics, tracking, or remote converter service.
- Do not print secrets, tokens, credential paths, or private environment values in logs.

## Setup

```powershell
cd D:\vibecode\snappy-docs-convert
git switch ai/phase-00-local-agent-setup
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\check-local.ps1
```

To pack a small AI-friendly context bundle:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\pack-context.ps1
```

The packed output is written to `docs/ai-context/repomix-output.md` and is ignored by git.

## Next Phase Summary

The next recommended implementation phase is Phase 2: LibreOffice headless engine discovery and conversion pipeline. Wait for owner approval before starting it.
